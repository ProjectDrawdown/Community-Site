name: Water Distribution Efficiency
description: Project Drawdown defines water distribution as reducing water
  leakage or oversupply of regional water, which reduces pumping and
  pressurization electricity and associated greenhouse gas emissions. This
  solution replaces conventional water system management with no specific leak
  detection program.
